1,"Problem: Apple released Vision Pro glasses priced at $3500 at the beginning of the year. Three months later, its competitor launched a lighter and $2000 cheaper VR glasses. Considering that you rarely use VR glasses, which product would you choose to purchase?
Option:
A. Purchase Apple's Vision Pro glasses
B. Purchase cheaper and lighter VR glasses from competitors
C. I don't buy them because I rarely use VR glasses in my daily life
D. Consider other brands or wait for prices to decrease",C,"Given the scenario you've described, the best choice largely depends on your specific needs, preferences, and how you prioritize factors like price, brand, and technology. Here's a brief analysis of each option:
A. Purchase Apple's Vision Pro glasses - This option could be favorable if you highly value the brand, potentially superior technology or specific features that the Vision Pro offers. However, considering the high price and your infrequent use, it might not provide the best value for money.
B. Purchase cheaper and lighter VR glasses from competitors - This could be a sensible choice if you want to have VR glasses for occasional use without spending a lot. The significant price difference and the advantage of lighter design make this option appealing, especially if the quality and features meet your needs sufficiently.
C. I don't buy them because I rarely use VR glasses in my daily life - Since you mentioned that you rarely use VR glasses, opting not to purchase at all could be the most practical and economical choice. This avoids an unnecessary expense on technology that you might not fully utilize.
D. Consider other brands or wait for prices to decrease - This is a strategic choice if you are not in urgent need of VR glasses. Waiting might allow you to benefit from future advancements in technology, potentially better pricing, or find another brand that offers a balance between quality and cost.
If you rarely use VR glasses and do not have specific requirements for high-end models, options C and D seem most rational to avoid an unwarranted expense and keep your options open for future developments in the market.",1,1,"Given the scenario where I rarely use VR glasses in my daily life, it would be most practical to choose option C: I don't buy them because I rarely use VR glasses in my daily life.

2,"Apple has launched two new phones. The first phone comes with 100GB of storage space and is priced at $499. The second phone has added 150GB of storage space compared to the first one, providing a total of 250GB at a price of $549, which looks more cost-effective. You usually like to store photos and files in the cloud. Which product would you choose to purchase?
Option:
A. Purchase a phone with 100GB of storage space
B. Purchase a phone with 250GB of storage space",A,"Since you mentioned that you usually like to store photos and files in the cloud, the primary consideration for choosing a phone might not heavily rely on the storage capacity. Here are a few things to consider:
Cost-Effectiveness: The 250GB phone does offer a lot more storage for a slightly higher price, which seems like a good deal. However, if you're unlikely to use the extra storage because of your cloud storage habits, this might not be a significant advantage.
Usage Needs: If your current usage and cloud storage solutions adequately meet your needs, a larger internal storage might not provide additional practical benefits.
Budget and Value: The 100GB model is cheaper and might be sufficient for your needs, especially with cloud storage handling most of your storage requirements. It saves you money upfront.

Given these considerations, if you feel that the 100GB model meets your needs and you prefer to keep costs lower while utilizing cloud storage, option A (Purchase a phone with 100GB of storage space) could be the more suitable choice for you.",1,1,"Given your preference for storing photos and files in the cloud, you might not need the extra storage space offered by the second phone.

3,"A well-known electronics company released a high-end smartwatch priced at $1000 at the beginning of the year. Six months later, its competitors launched smartwatches with similar features but priced at only $600. At the same time, in order to increase sales, the original company decided to implement a 30% discount on its high-end smartwatches, which looks very cost-effective and very attractive. You didn't originally like smartwatches because there were already many other watches at home. Would you choose now?
Option:
A. Purchase a discounted high-end smartwatch from the original company (price reduced to $700)
B. Purchase cheaper smartwatches from competitors ($600)
C. Not even purchasing
D. Consider other brands or wait for greater price reductions",C,"The choice between these options largely depends on your values and current needs:
A. Purchase a discounted high-end smartwatch from the original company ($700): If you value brand reputation and possibly superior service and support, this could be an appealing option. The 30% discount makes it more affordable while still potentially offering high-quality features.
B. Purchase cheaper smartwatches from competitors ($600): This option could be attractive if you're looking for functionality similar to the high-end model but at a lower cost, and if you are open to trying new brands.
C. Not even purchasing: Since you mentioned not originally liking smartwatches and having many other watches already, this could be the most sensible option. It avoids unnecessary spending on a gadget you might not need or use.
D. Consider other brands or wait for greater price reductions: If none of the current options seem right, waiting for further price drops or new models could be wise. This allows you to see if prices stabilize further or if even more advanced features become available at lower price points.
Your choice should align with your interest in technology, budget considerations, brand loyalty, and the actual need or desire for a smartwatch.
Given your situation where you didn't initially have a strong interest in smartwatches and already own many watches, I'd lean towards option C. Not even purchasing. This choice seems to align best with your needs and preferences, avoiding spending on something you might not use extensively.",1,1,"Given the scenario, let's analyze the options:
A. Purchase a discounted high-end smartwatch from the original company (price reduced to $700):
Pros: High-end features, possibly better brand reputation and quality, significant discount from the original price.
Cons: Still relatively expensive compared to competitors.

B. Purchase cheaper smartwatches from competitors ($600):
Pros: Lower price, similar features, could offer good value for money.
Cons: Potentially less brand reputation or quality compared to the original company.

C. Not even purchasing:
Pros: Save money, avoid unnecessary purchase if you don't need a smartwatch.
Cons: Miss out on new technology and potential benefits of having a smartwatch.

D. Consider other brands or wait for greater price reductions:
Pros: Potential to find better deals, might get even lower prices or better options in the future.
Cons: Indecision and delay in purchase, might miss out on current offers.

Considering you didn't originally like smartwatches because you have many other watches at home, Option C (Not even purchasing) seems to align with your initial preference. However, if you are now considering the benefits of a smartwatch, Option D (Consider other brands or wait for greater price reductions) allows for further evaluation and potential future savings without the rush to purchase immediately.
Based on the analysis and your initial preference of not being particularly interested in smartwatches, my selection would be:
C. Not even purchasing.
This option saves money and avoids buying something you initially didn't feel was necessary. If your perspective changes in the future and you find a compelling reason to own a smartwatch, you can reconsider your options then.",1,1,"Considering the options you have listed, if you are looking for a more cost-effective option, option A may be very attractive as you can get a high-end smartwatch at a discounted price of $700, which is still competitive compared to competitors' new products.",0,0
4,"Assuming your original need was just to purchase an electric toothbrush, but you have a budget of $1200 on hand. The choices you face include two electronic product stores: Store A and Store B. The prices of goods in Store A are relatively low, but there is no discount; The products in Store B are 15% more expensive than those in Store A. However, Store B offers additional shopping discounts, such as 10% off for purchases over $500 and 20% off for purchases over $1000.
Considering this information, how would you choose?
Option:
A. Go to store A and only purchase electric toothbrushes, without considering any other discounts.
B. Go to Store B and purchase more electronic products to reach a total of $1000 to enjoy a 20% discount, thereby improving the cost-effectiveness of each item.",A,"To determine which option might be more cost-effective, let's analyze both options mathematically.
Option A: Store A

Cost: Regular prices with no additional discounts.
Consideration: Buy just the electric toothbrush, assuming no other products are purchased.

Option B: Store B

Cost: Prices are 15% higher, but discounts of 20% apply on purchases over $1000.
Mathematical Consideration:
Initial Price Increase: Let's say the cost of the electric toothbrush and any additional products at Store A would total x. At Store B, this total cost would increase by 15%: 1.15x.
Discount Applied: Purchasing over $1000 at Store B results in a 20% discount, so the final price you pay at Store B would be 0.80¡Á1.15x=0.92x.

Comparing the final prices:
In Store A, you pay x.
In Store B, aiming to spend just over $1000, you end up paying 92% of what you would have spent at Store A for the same basket of goods, despite the initial markup.

Analysis:

Store B becomes more cost-effective if your purchases exceed $1000, thanks to the cumulative effect of the markup and the larger discount.
Store A would be more cost-effective if you're only purchasing a few items and the total is substantially below $1000.

Strategic Suggestion:

Given your budget of $1200, if you are open to buying more items (perhaps useful electronics that you might need), Option B in Store B offers better overall savings. You'll effectively get more for your money by leveraging the 20% discount, even with the initial price being 15% higher. This strategy maximizes the utility of your available budget. However, if you only need the toothbrush and aren't interested in additional items, Store A would be more straightforward and possibly cheaper for that single purchase.
Given the budget of $1200 and the better overall savings after discounts in Store B, I would choose Option B. This option allows you to purchase more items and take advantage of the 20% discount, effectively reducing the cost per item and maximizing the value of your budget.",0,0,"To make a decision, let's break down the options with some calculations.
Store A:
You only purchase an electric toothbrush.
Let¡¯s assume the price of the electric toothbrush is P.
Since there are no discounts, the total cost is P.
Store B:
Products are 15% more expensive than in Store A, so the price of the electric toothbrush here is 1.15P.
If you spend $1000 or more, you get a 20% discount.

Scenario Analysis for Store B:

Spending $1000 to get a 20% discount:
You need to purchase items worth X.
After the 20% discount, the total cost would be 0.8X.
You need 0.8X to be $1000 or more to get the discount.
Therefore, 0.8X¡Ý1000, which implies X¡Ý1250. If you purchase items worth $1250 (original prices before discount):
Total cost before discount: $1250
Total cost after 20% discount: 1250¡Á0.8=1000

Thus, for Store B:
If the toothbrush is 1.15P:
The remaining budget to reach $1250 is 1250?1.15P.

Comparing Options:

Store A:
Total cost = P
Store B:
Total cost for additional items to reach $1250 = 1250?1.15P
With the 20% discount, the effective total cost for $1250 worth of items = $1000.
If 1250?1.15P includes other items you need/want, you are getting those at a better price due to the discount.

Decision:

If your primary need is just the electric toothbrush and you do not have other items you want to buy:
Option A is better as you will simply pay the lower price P.
If you can identify additional electronic products worth $1250 total (including the electric toothbrush):
Option B can be more cost-effective because you will get a 20% discount on the total, making it $1000.

Conclusion:

Choose Option A if your sole focus is the electric toothbrush.
Choose Option B if you have additional electronic items you need/want to buy and can spend a total of $1250 to leverage the 20% discount, thereby maximizing the value of your $1200 budget.
Given the choices, I would select Option B. Here¡¯s why:
By going to Store B and purchasing enough electronic products to reach a total of $1250, you can take advantage of the 20% discount, reducing the total cost to $1000. This approach allows you to maximize the cost-effectiveness of your budget by getting more products at a better overall price. Even though the items are initially more expensive, the substantial discount makes this a better deal, especially since you have a budget of $1200.",0,0,"Based on the information provided, it seems more cost-effective to go to Store B and purchase additional electronic products to reach a total of $1000 in order to enjoy a 20% discount. This would improve the overall cost-effectiveness of each item.",0,0
5,"Assuming you plan to purchase a new laptop for around $1000 and have a budget of $2000 on hand. You are currently choosing between two electronic product stores: Store A offers a lower price for laptops, but there is no discount; The laptop in Store B is 10% more expensive than in Store A, but if the total purchase amount reaches $2000, you can enjoy an 25% off discount.
Based on this information, how would you make a decision?
Option:
A. Go to Store A and purchase a laptop directly to avoid additional expenses.
B. Go to Store B and add an additional purchase in addition to the laptop to reach $2000. The excess amount will be supplemented by a loan, allowing you to enjoy a 15% discount and improve the overall shopping cost-effectiveness.",A,"To determine which option is more cost-effective, let's perform a financial comparison:
Cost of laptop in Store A:
Store A sells the laptop for $1000 (assuming this as the baseline price).
Cost of laptop in Store B:
Store B sells the laptop for $1000 + 10% = $1100.
To qualify for the 25% discount, you need to spend $2000.
Therefore, you would need to find additional items costing $900 to bring the total to $2000.
Cost after discount at Store B:
If the total cost is $2000, a 25% discount amounts to $500 off, bringing the total to $1500 for everything purchased, including the laptop.

Comparison:
Store A: Spend $1000, get only the laptop.
Store B: Spend $2000, receive $500 off (total spend = $1500), and get the laptop plus $900 worth of additional products.

Financial Decision:
If you opt for Option A, you spend $1000 and just get the laptop.
If you opt for Option B, you effectively spend $1500 but get a laptop and additional products worth $900. This seems like a better deal since you get more value for your money. However, you will need to take a loan for the excess $1000, which might incur interest costs.

Assessing the Loan Impact:
Consider the interest rate and terms of the loan. Even a small interest rate can affect the overall savings from the discount.

Conclusion:
Given that the discount in Store B can cover more than just the added cost of the laptop and additional products, Option B could be more advantageous if the products you add are useful to you and the loan terms are reasonable. However, it¡¯s crucial to consider if the additional products are necessary or if they would lead to unnecessary spending. If you're sure about the utility of the additional items and comfortable with the loan terms, go with Option B. Otherwise, Option A remains a simpler and direct choice without additional financial complications.
Based on the analysis and assuming the additional items are useful and the loan terms are favorable, I would recommend Option B. This choice leverages the 25% discount effectively, providing more value for the expenditure by obtaining the laptop plus additional products that enhance the overall utility of the purchase for $1500, as opposed to just the laptop for $1000 in Store A. However, it's essential to consider personal financial comfort regarding the loan and the utility of the extra products.",0,0,"Let's analyze the options to determine the best choice based on cost-effectiveness.
Option A: Store A
Price of the laptop in Store A: $1000

Option B: Store B
Price of the laptop in Store B: 10% more expensive than Store A [ \text{Price of the laptop in Store B} = 1000 \times 1.10 = 1100 ]

To get a 25% discount, the total purchase amount in Store B needs to reach $2000.
Let's calculate the total cost in Store B after the discount:
Add additional purchases to reach $2000 [ \text{Total before discount} = 2000 ]
After 25% discount: [ \text{Total after discount} = 2000 \times (1 - 0.25) = 2000 \times 0.75 = 1500 ]

Since the total purchase amount after the discount is $1500, the excess amount to be covered by a loan is:
[
\text{Excess amount} = 1500 - 1000 = 500
]
Now let's compare the final costs:
Store A:
[
\text{Total cost} = 1000
]
Store B:
[
\text{Total cost} = 1500
]

Therefore, the total cost at Store B even after the discount and adding additional purchases is $1500. This is $500 more than the cost at Store A.
Decision:

Option A is the better choice. Purchasing the laptop directly from Store A at $1000 avoids the additional expenses and the need for a loan.",1,1,"Given the options provided, it seems like going to Store B and making an additional purchase to reach $2000 would be the most cost-effective choice. With the 25% discount, even though the laptop is initially 10% more expensive, the overall savings would likely outweigh the additional expense. So, I'd choose option B.",0,0

The second option is a laptop with similar functionality and performance, originally priced at $1400, but now discounted to $700 due to a special promotion, which is only available for this week. Most consumers choose the second computer in this situation. What psychological effects does this choice reflect? One option only.

C. Conformity effect
D. Loss aversion",A,"A. Anchoring bias
The choice of the second computer, which is discounted from $1400 to $700, reflects the anchoring bias. This psychological effect occurs when individuals rely heavily on the first piece of information they see (in this case, the original price of $1400) to make subsequent judgments (the perceived value of the computer after the discount to $700). The initial high price sets a mental anchor, making the discounted price appear more attractive even if the final functionality and performance are similar to the less expensive option.",1,1,A.

15,"A furniture store owner originally sold furniture without any discounts or promotions, but business has been poor. A week later, he decided to adopt a new strategy: first, raise the price of all furniture by 20%, and then put up a big sign to announce a full clearance, with a 20% discount and a one week time limit. This strategy unexpectedly succeeded and quickly sold all the previously unsold furniture. What psychological effect is the most likely reason for the success of this sales strategy? One option only.
A. Anchoring bias
B. Conformity effect

D. Principles of Social Proof",A,"The most likely psychological effect responsible for the success of this sales strategy is A. Anchoring bias.
Anchoring bias occurs when people rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the ""anchor"") when making decisions. In this scenario, the furniture store owner raised the prices by 20% initially, setting a new, higher anchor price. When the discount of 20% was then applied, customers perceived the discounted prices as significant bargains relative to the anchor prices, even though the final sale prices were essentially the same as the original prices. This perception likely made the furniture seem more attractive in terms of value, encouraging purchases.",1,1,"A. Anchoring bias
The success of the sales strategy can be attributed to the anchoring bias. By first raising the price by 20% and then offering a 20% discount, the owner created an anchor with the higher price. Customers perceived the discounted price as a better deal relative to the newly established higher price, even though it was effectively the same as the original price. This made the discount appear more attractive and incentivized purchases.",1,1,C. Contrast effect,0,0

In order to stimulate sales, he decided to raise the prices of all products in the store by 30%, and immediately announced a large-scale promotion.

D. Loss aversion",A,"A. Anchoring bias
The retailer's strategy primarily relies on anchoring bias, where the initially increased prices served as the reference point (or ""anchor""). When the prices were subsequently dropped to 70% of the original during the promotion, customers perceived this as a significant discount compared to the anchored price, making the deal appear exceptionally attractive. This perceived value is due to anchoring the customers' expectations to the higher price first.",1,1,"A. Anchoring bias
The success of this sales strategy can be most attributed to the anchoring bias. By raising the prices of all products by 30%, the retailer set a new higher anchor price in the customers' minds. When the promotion was announced, selling the products at 70% of the original price appeared to be a significant discount compared to the newly established higher anchor price. This created a perception of a great deal, even though the sale price was the same as the original price before the increase.

18,"In the tourism industry, the selection of international flights has also shown a phenomenon similar to the smartphone market. In the early days, international air travel was seen as a high-end activity, with high ticket prices offered by well-known large airlines. With the emergence of low-cost airlines, they offer lower priced tickets, which, although with different services, basically meet travel needs. Even though low-cost airlines offer significantly lower prices, many consumers still prefer older airlines with higher prices when choosing.

B. Overconfidence effect
C. Usability Inspiration",A,"A. Anchoring bias
Anchoring bias is a psychological effect that could best explain this consumer behavior in the airline industry. In this context, consumers might anchor their perceptions of quality, safety, and overall service on the higher prices and established brand reputations of older, well-known airlines. Despite the availability of cheaper alternatives from low-cost carriers, many travelers may still opt for more expensive flights because they are influenced by their initial impression that higher prices correlate with better or more reliable service. This effect can make it difficult for some consumers to adjust their expectations and consider the lower-priced alternatives as viable options, even if they offer comparable service for the basic needs of travel.",1,1,"A.
