1,"Assuming there are two daycare centers of different sizes, one is a large daycare center in the city center that receives 100 children per day, and the other is a small daycare center in the suburbs that receives 10 children per day. These two daycare centers record the number of days a child falls ill every week. Large daycare centers in the city center and small daycare centers in the suburbs generally do not have more than 30% of children getting sick every day. Which daycare center do you think records more sick days with a percentage higher than 60%?
A. A large daycare center in the city center
B. Small daycare centers in the suburbs
C. The percentages recorded by the two daycare centers are similar (i.e. the difference is within 5%)",B,"To determine which daycare center records more sick days with a percentage higher than 60%, let's calculate the maximum number of sick children each daycare center can have while still staying below 30% sickness rate.
For the large daycare center in the city center:
Maximum number of sick children per day = 30% of 100 children = 30 children

For the small daycare center in the suburbs:
Maximum number of sick children per day = 30% of 10 children = 3 children

To exceed a 60% sickness rate, the number of sick children should be more than 60% of the total children in each daycare center.
For the large daycare center in the city center:
Threshold for exceeding 60% sickness rate = 60% of 100 children = 60 children
Since the maximum is 30 children, which is less than 60, the large daycare center does not exceed 60% sickness rate.

For the small daycare center in the suburbs:
Threshold for exceeding 60% sickness rate = 60% of 10 children = 6 children
Since the maximum is 3 children, which is less than 6, the small daycare center also does not exceed 60% sickness rate.

Therefore, both daycare centers do not record more sick days with a percentage higher than 60%. The percentages recorded by the two daycare centers are likely similar, indicating that the percentage of sick children is within the range of 30%.",0,0,"To determine which daycare center is more likely to record more days with a percentage of children falling ill higher than 60%, we need to consider the statistical concept known as the ""law of large numbers."" This principle states that as a sample size increases, the observed outcomes become more predictable and closer to the expected average.
For the large daycare center in the city center with 100 children per day, fluctuations in the percentage of children falling ill are more likely to average out. Given that the maximum illness rate is 30%, the probability of the percentage suddenly jumping to over 60% on any given day is quite low due to the stabilizing effect of the large sample size.
On the other hand, the small daycare center in the suburbs, with only 10 children per day, is more susceptible to larger percentage swings due to its small sample size. If just 6 out of the 10 children fall ill on a single day, that immediately results in a 60% illness rate. With smaller numbers, random variations and extreme outcomes (both high and low) are more likely to occur.
Given this information, it is more likely that the small daycare center in the suburbs will record more days where the percentage of children falling ill is higher than 60%.
Thus, the answer is:
B. Small daycare centers in the suburbs.",1,1,"Based on the given information, the large daycare center in the city center is likely to record more sick days with a percentage higher than 60%.",0,0
2,"Assuming there are two pet stores of different sizes, one is a large chain pet store and the other is a small family run pet store. These two pet shops record the proportion of pet medications sold due to illness every month.
Large chain pet stores sell 1000 bottles of pet medicine per month, while small family run pet stores sell about 100 bottles of pet medicine per month. Within a year, large chain pet stores and small family run pet stores typically sell 40% of medication for disease treatment each month. Which pet store do you think sells more than 60% of disease medications in a certain month?
A. Large chain pet stores
B. Small family run pet shops
C. The sales ratios of the two pet stores are similar (with a difference of less than 5%)",B,"To determine which pet store sells more than 60% of disease medications in a certain month, we can calculate the monthly sales of medications for disease treatment for each store and compare them based on the given information.
Large chain pet stores sell 40% of medications for disease treatment each month, which would be 0.40℅1000=400 bottles monthly.
Small family run pet stores also sell 40% of medications for disease treatment each month, equal to 0.40℅100=40 bottles monthly.
Therefore, in a certain month, the large chain pet store sells more medication for disease treatment compared to the small family run pet store. Thus, the answer is:
A. Large chain pet stores
The difference in sales ratios between the two stores is significant, with the large chain pet store selling significantly more medications for disease treatment than the small family run pet store.",0,0,"Given the scenario, the large chain pet stores sell 1000 bottles of pet medicine per month and the small family run pet stores sell 100 bottles per month. Both stores typically sell 40% of their medication for disease treatment each month.
To determine which store is more likely to sell more than 60% of disease medications in a certain month, we need to consider the variability in the proportion of disease medication sales, which is influenced by the sample size. The larger the sample size, the less variability there will be in the proportion due to the Law of Large Numbers.
Large chain pet stores:
Monthly sales: 1000 bottles
Expected disease medication sales: 0.40 * 1000 = 400 bottles
Standard deviation (考) of the proportion: ﹟[p(1-p)/n] = ﹟[0.4 * 0.6 / 1000] ＞ 0.0155 (1.55%)
Small family run pet stores:
Monthly sales: 100 bottles
Expected disease medication sales: 0.40 * 100 = 40 bottles
Standard deviation (考) of the proportion: ﹟[p(1-p)/n] = ﹟[0.4 * 0.6 / 100] ＞ 0.049 (4.9%)

The small family run pet store, with a smaller sample size (100 bottles), will have a higher standard deviation in the proportion of disease medication sales. This means their proportion of disease medication sales is more variable month-to-month compared to the large chain pet stores.
Since the question is asking about which store is more likely to sell more than 60% of disease medications in a certain month, we should consider the higher variability in the proportions. The small family run pet store, due to its smaller sample size and higher standard deviation, is more likely to experience such a deviation in any given month.
Thus, the correct answer is:
B. Small family run pet shops",1,1,"Based on the provided information, the large chain pet store sells 400 bottles (40% of 1000) of pet medicine for disease treatment each month, while the small family-run pet store sells 40 bottles (40% of 100) of pet medicine for disease treatment each month. Therefore, in a certain month, the large chain pet store sells more than 60% of disease medications. So, the answer is A. Large chain pet stores.",0,0
3,"Assuming there are two fitness centers of different sizes, one is a chain fitness center and the other is a small private gym. These two fitness centers record the weight changes of new members every week.
Large chain fitness centers admit 100 new members per week, while small private gyms only admit 10 new members per week. Within a year, typically 20% of new members in large chain fitness centers and small private gyms lose over 5 kilograms in weight each month. Which fitness center do you think had more than 60% of new students lose more than 5 kilograms in a certain month?
A. Large chain fitness centers
B. Small private gym
C. The records of the two fitness centers are similar (with a difference of less than 5%)",B,"To determine which fitness center had more than 60% of new students lose more than 5 kilograms in a certain month, we can calculate the numbers based on the provided information:
Large Chain Fitness Center:
Admits 100 new members per week.
20% of new members lose over 5 kilograms each month.
Small Private Gym:
Admits 10 new members per week.
20% of new members lose over 5 kilograms each month.

Let's calculate the number of new members who lose more than 5 kilograms in a certain month for each fitness center:
Large Chain Fitness Center:
Number of new members losing over 5 kilograms per week: 100 * 20% = 20
Number of new members losing over 5 kilograms in a certain month (4 weeks): 20 * 4 = 80
Small Private Gym:
Number of new members losing over 5 kilograms per week: 10 * 20% = 2
Number of new members losing over 5 kilograms in a certain month (4 weeks): 2 * 4 = 8

Comparing the results:
Large Chain Fitness Center: 80 new members lost over 5 kilograms in a certain month.
Small Private Gym: 8 new members lost over 5 kilograms in a certain month.

The large chain fitness center had significantly more new students losing more than 5 kilograms in a certain month compared to the small private gym. Therefore, the answer is A. Large Chain Fitness Centers.",0,0,"To determine which fitness center is more likely to have over 60% of new students lose more than 5 kilograms in a certain month, we need to consider the likelihood of this happening given the information provided.
Let's break down the problem:
Large Chain Fitness Center:
Admits 100 new members per week.
Typically, 20% of new members lose more than 5 kilograms in weight each month.
Expected number of members losing more than 5 kilograms in a month = 0.20 * 100 = 20 members.
Small Private Gym:
Admits 10 new members per week.
Typically, 20% of new members lose more than 5 kilograms in weight each month.
Expected number of members losing more than 5 kilograms in a month = 0.20 * 10 = 2 members.

Analyzing the probability of exceeding 60%:
Calculating 60% Threshold:
For the large chain fitness center, 60% of 100 members = 60 members.
For the small private gym, 60% of 10 members = 6 members.

Comparing the Expected Values to the Thresholds:
Large Chain Fitness Center:
Expected 20 members lose more than 5 kilograms.
The probability of exceeding 60 members (60%) is extremely low because the expected value (20) is far below the threshold (60).
Small Private Gym:
Expected 2 members lose more than 5 kilograms.
The probability of exceeding 6 members (60%) is also low, but less extreme compared to the large fitness center because the numbers involved are smaller.

Conclusion:
Since both centers have an expected 20% of members losing more than 5 kilograms and this percentage is far from 60%, it is highly unlikely for either center to have more than 60% of new students lose over 5 kilograms in a month.
However, due to the smaller sample size, the small private gym could experience higher variability in percentages. In a very rare case, it might see 6 out of 10 members (60%) losing weight, whereas it is nearly impossible for the large chain fitness center to see such a high percentage due to the law of large numbers (the larger the sample size, the more the result will align with the expected percentage).
Therefore, the small private gym has a relatively higher chance (although still very small) of having a month where over 60% of new students lose more than 5 kilograms.
The answer is B: Small private gym.",1,1,"To calculate which fitness center had more than 60% of new students lose more than 5 kilograms in a certain month, we can start by determining the number of members who would potentially lose over 5 kilograms in each center.
For the large chain fitness center:
Number of new members per week: 100
Number of new members per year: 100 * 52 = 5200
Percentage of new members potentially losing over 5 kilograms per month: 20%
For the small private gym:
Number of new members per week: 10
Number of new members per year: 10 * 52 = 520
Percentage of new members potentially losing over 5 kilograms per month: 20%
Now, let's calculate the number of new members potentially losing over 5 kilograms per month for each center:
For the large chain fitness center: 5200 * 20% = 1040
For the small private gym: 520 * 20% = 104
Now, we compare the percentage of new members potentially losing over 5 kilograms in a certain month:
For the large chain fitness center: (1040 / 5200) * 100% = 20%
For the small private gym: (104 / 520) * 100% = 20%
Both fitness centers have the same percentage of new members potentially losing over 5 kilograms in a certain month, which is 20%. Therefore, the answer is:

4,"Assuming there are two bookstores of different sizes, one is a large chain bookstore and the other is a small independent bookstore. These two bookstores record monthly sales of different books.
Large chain bookstores sell 10000 books per month, while small independent bookstores sell about 100 books per month. Within a year, usually 30% of the total sales of large chain bookstores and small independent bookstores are bestsellers each month. Do you think bookstores are more likely to have best-selling books accounting for over 60% of total sales in a certain month?
A. Large chain bookstore
B. Small independent bookstore
C. The sales situation of the two bookstores is similar (with a difference of less than 5%)",B,"Based on the provided information, let's analyze the likelihood of each type of bookstore having best-selling books that account for over 60% of their total sales in a certain month:
A. Large Chain Bookstore:
Monthly sales: 10,000 books
Monthly bestsellers: 30% of 10,000 = 3,000 bestsellers
Percentage of bestsellers in total sales: 3,000 / 10,000 = 30%
To exceed 60% bestsellers in total sales, it would need to sell at least 6,000 bestsellers per month.
Based on the given data, it is less likely for the large chain bookstore to have over 60% of bestsellers in a certain month.

B. Small Independent Bookstore:
Monthly sales: 100 books
Monthly bestsellers: 30% of 100 = 30 bestsellers
Percentage of bestsellers in total sales: 30 / 100 = 30%
To exceed 60% bestsellers in total sales, it would need to sell at least 60 bestsellers per month.
Due to the smaller scale, the small independent bookstore has a higher chance of having over 60% of bestsellers in a certain month compared to the large chain bookstore.

C. The Sales Situation of the Two Bookstores:
The difference in bestseller sales between the two types of bookstores is significant: 3,000 bestsellers for the large chain and 30 bestsellers for the small independent.
The large chain's sales of bestsellers are much higher than the small independent.
Hence, it can be concluded that the sales situation of the two bookstores is not similar, with a substantial difference in bestseller sales.

Therefore, the small independent bookstore (option B) is more likely to have best-selling books that account for over 60% of total sales in a certain month compared to the large chain bookstore (option A), and the sales situations of the two bookstores are not similar (option C).",1,1,"Given the information, we can analyze the probability of best-selling books accounting for over 60% of total sales in a certain month for both types of bookstores.
Large Chain Bookstore:
Monthly book sales: 10,000 books
Expected number of bestsellers per month (30%): 3,000 books
For bestsellers to account for over 60% of sales:
Required number of bestsellers: 10,000 * 0.60 = 6,000 books
Small Independent Bookstore:
Monthly book sales: 100 books
Expected number of bestsellers per month (30%): 30 books
For bestsellers to account for over 60% of sales:
Required number of bestsellers: 100 * 0.60 = 60 books

Analysis:
For the large chain bookstore, a significant deviation from the average (3,000 to 6,000 bestsellers) is needed. Given the large sample size, sales numbers are more likely to adhere to the expected distribution, meaning significant deviations are less probable due to the law of large numbers.
For the small independent bookstore, the absolute number of books sold is much smaller. Hence, random fluctuations and deviations from the average (30 to 60 bestsellers) are more probable. In smaller sample sizes, variations are more noticeable, and it is easier to exceed the expected percentage due to random chance.

Conclusion:
B. Small independent bookstore
Small independent bookstores are more likely to have best-selling books accounting for over 60% of total sales in a certain month due to greater variability and susceptibility to random fluctuations in smaller sample sizes.",1,1,"Based on the provided information, it's more likely that the large chain bookstore would have best-selling books accounting for over 60% of total sales in a certain month.",0,0
5,"Assuming there are two farms of different sizes, one is a large farm and the other is a small family run farm. The crop yields recorded by these two farms every quarter.
Large farms produce 1000 tons of agricultural products per quarter, while small family run farms only produce 100 tons of agricultural products per quarter. Within a year, large farms and small family run farms typically have 10% of their agricultural products unqualified every quarter. Which farm do you think is more likely to produce more substandard agricultural products with a proportion higher than 50% in a certain quarter?
A. Small family run farms
B. Large scale farms
C. The yield situation of the two farms is similar (with a difference of less than 5%)",A,"Based on the information provided, we can calculate the expected amount of unqualified agricultural products for each farm in a quarter and compare the proportions to determine which farm is more likely to produce more substandard agricultural products exceeding 50%.
For large farms:
Expected unqualified products per quarter = 1000 tons x 10% = 100 tons

For small family run farms:
Expected unqualified products per quarter = 100 tons x 10% = 10 tons

To compare the proportions of unqualified products:
Large farms: 100 tons out of 1000 tons = 10%
Small family run farms: 10 tons out of 100 tons = 10%

Therefore, the proportion of unqualified products for both farms is the same, which is 10%. The answer is:
C. The yield situation of the two farms is similar (with a difference of less than 5%)",0,0,"To determine which farm is more likely to produce more than 50% of substandard agricultural products in a certain quarter, we need to analyze the situation statistically.
Large Farm:
Total production per quarter: 1000 tons
Unqualified products: 10% of 1000 tons = 100 tons
Substandard products per quarter (mean): 100 tons
Small Family Run Farm:
Total production per quarter: 100 tons
Unqualified products: 10% of 100 tons = 10 tons
Substandard products per quarter (mean): 10 tons

To produce more than 50% substandard products in a quarter:
Large Farm: more than 500 tons of substandard products out of 1000 tons.
Small Family Run Farm: more than 50 tons of substandard products out of 100 tons.

Given that the mean for unqualified products is 10% for both farms, producing more than 50% substandard products would be a significant deviation from the mean.
This is a question of variability. Smaller sample sizes (small family farm's production) tend to have higher relative variability compared to larger sample sizes (large farm's production). This means that the small family farm is statistically more likely to experience extreme variations in the proportion of substandard products.
Conclusion:

A. Small family run farms are more likely to produce more substandard agricultural products with a proportion higher than 50% in a certain quarter due to higher relative variability in their smaller production scale.",1,1,"Based on the given information:
Large farms produce 1000 tons of agricultural products per quarter.
Small family run farms produce 100 tons of agricultural products per quarter.
Both types of farms have 10% of their agricultural products unqualified every quarter.

To determine which farm is more likely to produce more than 50% substandard agricultural products in a certain quarter, let's calculate the threshold for each:
Large Farms:
Total production per quarter: 1000 tons.
10% unqualified products: 1000 * 0.10 = 100 tons.
Maximum acceptable substandard products: 100 tons (since 100 is 10% of 1000).
Small Family Run Farms:
Total production per quarter: 100 tons.
10% unqualified products: 100 * 0.10 = 10 tons.
Maximum acceptable substandard products: 10 tons (since 10 is 10% of 100).

Comparing the maximum acceptable substandard products to the threshold of 50%:
Large Farms: Maximum acceptable substandard products = 100 tons.
50% of total production = 1000 * 0.50 = 500 tons.
Clearly, 100 tons (maximum substandard) is less than 500 tons. Therefore, large farms are less likely to exceed 50% substandard products.
Small Family Run Farms: Maximum acceptable substandard products = 10 tons.
50% of total production = 100 * 0.50 = 50 tons.
10 tons (maximum substandard) is greater than 50 tons. Therefore, small family run farms are more likely to exceed 50% substandard products.

Conclusion: Small family run farms are more likely to produce more than 50% substandard agricultural products in a certain quarter compared to large farms.",1,1
6,"Assuming there are two hotels of different sizes, one is a large chain hotel, and the other is a small family run homestay. The number of guests received by these two hotels per month is recorded.
Large chain hotels receive 5000 guests per month, while small family run homestays only receive 500 guests per month. Within a year, large chain hotels and small family run homestays typically have a complaint rate of 9% every quarter.

So, based on the information provided, neither the large chain hotels nor the small family-run homestays are more likely to receive complaints exceeding 20% in a certain quarter.",0,0,"To determine which hotel is more likely to receive complaints exceeding 20% in a certain quarter, we need to analyze the variability of complaint rates based on the number of guests each hotel receives.
Given:
Large chain hotels receive 5000 guests per month, which totals 15,000 guests per quarter.
Small family-run homestays receive 500 guests per month, which totals 1,500 guests per quarter.
Both hotels have a complaint rate of 9% every quarter.

First, calculate the expected number of complaints:
Large chain hotels: 15,000 guests ℅ 0.09 = 1,350 complaints.
Small family-run homestays: 1,500 guests ℅ 0.09 = 135 complaints.

Now, consider the variability of complaints. The variability (or standard deviation) in the number of complaints can be described by a binomial distribution, but for large samples, it approximates a normal distribution.
For a binomial distribution, the standard deviation 考 is given by:
[ \sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} ]
where n is the number of trials (guests) and p is the probability of success (complaint rate).
Calculate the standard deviation for each hotel:
Large chain hotels:
[ \sigma_{\text{large}} = \sqrt{15,000 \times 0.09 \times (1 - 0.09)} = \sqrt{15,000 \times 0.09 \times 0.91} \approx 35.2 ]
Small family-run homestays:
[ \sigma_{\text{small}} = \sqrt{1,500 \times 0.09 \times (1 - 0.09)} = \sqrt{1,500 \times 0.09 \times 0.91} \approx 10.9 ]

The higher the standard deviation, the greater the variability in the number of complaints.
Next, calculate the threshold number of complaints that corresponds to a 20% complaint rate:
Large chain hotels: 15,000 guests ℅ 0.20 = 3,000 complaints.
Small family-run homestays: 1,500 guests ℅ 0.20 = 300 complaints.

Compare these thresholds to the expected number of complaints plus the standard deviation:
Large chain hotels: 1,350 (mean) + 35.2 (standard deviation) = 1,385.2 (well below 3,000).
Small family-run homestays: 135 (mean) + 10.9 (standard deviation) = 145.9 (well below 300).

Since the small family-run homestays have a smaller sample size, the variability relative to the mean is larger, making them more susceptible to significant deviations from the expected complaint rate.
Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. Small family-operated homestays",1,1,"Given the complaint rate and the difference in the number of guests, the small family-operated homestays are more likely to receive complaints exceeding 20% in a certain quarter.",1,1

Given this analysis, the large chain beauty stores are more likely to receive over 50% of customers choosing full beauty services in a certain quarter. This is because the sheer volume of skincare service appointments at the large chain stores significantly increases the likelihood of attracting more customers for full beauty services compared to the small private salon.",0,0,"To determine which beauty salon is more likely to receive over 50% of customers choosing full beauty services in a certain quarter, we need to consider the variability in the percentage of customers choosing full services.
Let's analyze the situation step by step:
Large Chain Beauty Stores:
Monthly appointments: 1000
Quarterly appointments: 1000 * 3 = 3000
Customers choosing full services weekly: 30% of 1000 = 300 customers
Customers choosing full services quarterly: 300 * 3 = 900 customers
Percentage of customers choosing full services quarterly: (900 / 3000) * 100% = 30%
Small Private Beauty Salons:
Monthly appointments: 100
Quarterly appointments: 100 * 3 = 300
Customers choosing full services weekly: 30% of 100 = 30 customers
Customers choosing full services quarterly: 30 * 3 = 90 customers
Percentage of customers choosing full services quarterly: (90 / 300) * 100% = 30%

Since both types of beauty salons have 30% of customers choosing full services, we need to consider the likelihood of this percentage varying significantly.
Variability and Statistical Significance

Large Chain Beauty Stores:
With 3000 appointments per quarter, the law of large numbers implies that the percentage of customers choosing full services (30%) is likely to be stable and close to the expected value.
Small Private Beauty Salons:
With only 300 appointments per quarter, there is more room for statistical fluctuations. Smaller sample sizes are more susceptible to variability, meaning that the actual percentage of customers choosing full services can deviate more from the expected 30%.

Probability of Exceeding 50%

For the large chain beauty stores, it is very unlikely that the percentage would deviate enough to exceed 50%, due to the large number of appointments smoothing out the variations.
For the small private beauty salons, the smaller number of appointments means that random fluctuations could more easily result in a percentage exceeding 50%.

Conclusion

Given the greater likelihood of significant deviations in smaller sample sizes, the small private beauty salon (B) is more likely to experience a situation where over 50% of its customers choose full beauty services in a certain quarter.",1,1,"Based on the information provided, the small private beauty salon is more likely to receive over 50% of customers choosing full beauty services in a certain quarter.",1,1
9,"Assuming there are two car repair shops of different sizes, one is a large chain repair shop and the other is a small independent repair shop. These two repair shops record the number of car repairs per week.

Among them, car repair shops of different scales usually have 40% of customers choosing car wash services every week while repairing. Which car repair shop do you think is more likely to receive over 65% of customers choosing car wash services while repairing in a certain quarter?
A. Large chain repair chain stores
B. Small independent repair shop
C. The maintenance situation of the two repair shops is similar (with a difference of less than 5%)",B,"To determine which car repair shop is more likely to receive over 65% of customers choosing car wash services while repairing in a certain quarter, we need to compare the absolute numbers of customers opting for car wash services for both the large chain repair shop and the small independent repair shop based on the information provided.
Large Chain Repair Shop:

Repairs 500 cars per month
40% of customers choose car wash services every week while repairing

Total customers choosing car wash services per month at the large chain repair shop = 500 cars/month * 40% = 200 cars/month
Small Independent Repair Shop:

Repairs 50 cars per month
40% of customers choose car wash services every week while repairing

Total customers choosing car wash services per month at the small independent repair shop = 50 cars/month * 40% = 20 cars/month
To determine the quarterly percentage of customers choosing car wash services, we calculate:
Total customers choosing car wash services per quarter = Total customers choosing car wash services per month * 3 (for 3 months in a quarter)
Large Chain Repair Shop: Total customers choosing car wash services per quarter = 200 cars/month * 3 = 600 cars/quarter

Percentage of customers choosing car wash services at the large chain repair shop = (600 cars/quarter / (500 cars/quarter)) * 100% = 120%
Small Independent Repair Shop: Total customers choosing car wash services per quarter = 20 cars/month * 3 = 60 cars/quarter

Percentage of customers choosing car wash services at the small independent repair shop = (60 cars/quarter / (50 cars/quarter)) * 100% = 120%
Based on the calculations, both repair shops are expected to have 120% of customers choosing car wash services, which is well over 65%. Therefore, the maintenance situation of the two repair shops is indeed similar, and both are likely to have over 65% of customers opting for car wash services while repairing in a certain quarter.",0,0,"To determine which car repair shop is more likely to receive over 65% of customers choosing car wash services while repairing in a certain quarter, we need to consider the number of car repairs they handle and the percentage of customers who choose the car wash service.
First, let＊s break down the data:
Large Chain Repair Shop

Repairs per month: 500 cars
Repairs per quarter (3 months): 500℅3=1500 cars

Small Independent Repair Shop

Repairs per month: 50 cars
Repairs per quarter (3 months): 50℅3=150 cars

Percentage of Customers Choosing Car Wash Services

Both shops have 40% of customers choosing car wash services every week.

To find the probability of more than 65% of customers choosing the car wash service in a quarter, we need to look at the variance and standard deviation for each shop.
Expected Number of Customers Choosing Car Wash Services

For each shop, the expected number of customers choosing car wash services is:
Large chain repair shop: 1500℅0.4=600
Small independent repair shop: 150℅0.4=60

Standard Deviation Calculation

The standard deviation (考) for a binomial distribution is given by:
[ \sigma = \sqrt{n \times p \times (1 - p)} ]
where n is the number of trials (total repairs), and p is the probability of success (choosing car wash).
For the large chain repair shop:
[ \sigma = \sqrt{1500 \times 0.4 \times 0.6} = \sqrt{360} \approx 18.97 ]
For the small independent repair shop:
[ \sigma = \sqrt{150 \times 0.4 \times 0.6} = \sqrt{36} = 6 ]

Probability Analysis

To determine the likelihood of more than 65% of customers choosing the car wash service, we need to calculate the z-score for 65%.
Number of customers representing 65%:
Large chain repair shop: 1500℅0.65=975
Small independent repair shop: 150℅0.65=97.5

Z-Score Calculation

The z-score is given by:
[ z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} ]
where X is the target value (number of customers choosing car wash), 米 is the expected value, and 考 is the standard deviation.
For the large chain repair shop:
[ z = \frac{975 - 600}{18.97} = \frac{375}{18.97} \approx 19.76 ]
For the small independent repair shop:
[ z = \frac{97.5 - 60}{6} = \frac{37.5}{6} \approx 6.25 ]

A z-score of 19.76 is extraordinarily high, suggesting the probability of such an event is virtually zero. On the other hand, a z-score of 6.25 is also very high but relatively more plausible than 19.76, though still highly unlikely.
Conclusion

Given the extremely high z-scores, both scenarios are highly improbable. However, since the z-score for the small independent repair shop (6.25) is lower than that of the large chain repair shop (19.76), the small independent repair shop has a comparatively higher probability (though still very low) of exceeding 65% of customers choosing car wash services in a quarter.
Therefore, the most accurate answer is:
B. Small independent repair shop",1,1,"Based on the provided information, the large chain repair shop repairs significantly more cars per month compared to the small independent repair shop.

10,"Assuming there are two restaurants of different sizes, one is a large chain restaurant located in the city center, and the other is a small family run restaurant in the suburbs. The weekly customer review scores recorded by these two restaurants.
Large chain restaurants sell 1000 servings of food per week, while small family run restaurants only sell 100 servings of food per week. Among them, restaurants of different sizes usually have 30% of customers give evaluations of the food every week. Which restaurant do you think is more likely to have over 45% of customers give reviews of food in a certain quarter?
A. Large chain restaurants
B. Small family run restaurants
C. The high scores obtained by the two restaurants are similar (the difference is within 5%)",B,"To determine which restaurant is more likely to have over 45% of customers give reviews of food in a certain quarter, we can analyze the scenario based on the information provided.
Large Chain Restaurant:
Sells 1000 servings of food per week.
Typically, 30% of customers give evaluations of the food every week.
Therefore, the large chain restaurant would have approximately 300 customers giving reviews of the food every week.
Small Family-Run Restaurant:
Sells 100 servings of food per week.
Also, 30% of customers give evaluations of the food every week.
As a result, the small family-run restaurant would have around 30 customers giving reviews of the food weekly.

Now, to see which restaurant is more likely to have over 45% of customers give reviews of food in a certain quarter, we need to consider an entire quarter, which comprises about 13 weeks.
Large Chain Restaurant:
Total customers giving reviews in a quarter: 300 * 13 = 3900 customers.
For over 45% of customers to give reviews, it would need at least 1755 customers (45% of 3900) to do so.
Small Family-Run Restaurant:
Total customers giving reviews in a quarter: 30 * 13 = 390 customers.
For over 45% of customers to give reviews, it would require a minimum of 175.5 customers (45% of 390) to do so.

Given these calculations, it is more likely that the Large Chain Restaurant would have over 45% of customers give reviews of food in a certain quarter compared to the Small Family-Run Restaurant. This is because the large chain restaurant has a significantly larger customer base, leading to more reviews being received overall.
Therefore, the answer is A. Large Chain Restaurants.",0,0,"To determine which restaurant is more likely to have over 45% of customers give reviews of food in a certain quarter, let's consider the probability and statistics involved in the evaluation process.
Review Probability Calculation:
Large Chain Restaurant:
Serves 1000 servings of food per week.
30% of customers typically give reviews weekly.
Weekly reviews: 1000℅0.30=300 reviews.
Total customers in a quarter (12 weeks): 1000℅12=12,000 customers.
Expected total reviews in a quarter: 300℅12=3,600 reviews.

Total customers in a quarter (12 weeks): 100℅12=1,200 customers.
Expected total reviews in a quarter: 30℅12=360 reviews.

Review Proportion Calculation:
Large Chain Restaurant:
To have over 45% of customers give reviews in a quarter: 0.45℅12,000=5,400 reviews.
Comparing expected reviews (3,600) with required reviews (5,400), the gap is large (unlikely to happen).
Small Family Run Restaurant:
To have over 45% of customers give reviews in a quarter: 0.45℅1,200=540 reviews.
Comparing expected reviews (360) with required reviews (540), the gap is smaller but still significant.

Statistical Consideration:
Given the larger sample size of the large chain restaurant, variability is lower compared to the small family-run restaurant.
In smaller samples (like the small family-run restaurant), statistical fluctuations and variations can more easily lead to higher or lower proportions of reviews.

Given these considerations, the small family-run restaurant, despite having a lower expected number of reviews overall, is statistically more likely to experience higher variability in customer behavior, thus making it more probable for them to have quarters where over 45% of customers give reviews.
Conclusion:
B. Small family run restaurants",1,1,"B. Small family run restaurants.

Statistical Variance and Likelihood:
The large multi hall chain cinema sells many more tickets (30,000) compared to the small independent cinema (3,000). With a larger sample size (tickets sold), the popcorn purchase percentage is likely to be closer to the expected 20% due to the law of large numbers, meaning less variance and more predictability.
The small independent cinema, with only 3,000 tickets sold, is more susceptible to variance. Smaller sample sizes tend to have greater fluctuations from the expected mean, meaning the percentage of customers buying popcorn can deviate more significantly from 20%.

Given the greater potential for variance in the small independent cinema's sales, it is more likely that it could experience a quarter where the percentage of popcorn buyers significantly deviates from the expected 20%. Thus, it is more likely to have over 45% of customers buying popcorn in a quarter compared to the large cinema, which will have more stable and predictable numbers due to its larger customer base.

Small Family Park: 40% of 30,000 = 12,000 purchases.
Statistical Variability:
Larger sample sizes (like the 300,000 visitors for the large theme park) tend to have less variability and more stable averages due to the Law of Large Numbers.
Smaller sample sizes (like the 30,000 visitors for the small family park) tend to have more variability and can deviate more from the average percentage.

Given that the question asks which park is more likely to have over 70% of customers purchasing snacks, we are interested in deviations from the average behavior.
Analysis:
Large Theme Park: With 300,000 visitors, the percentage of snack purchasers will be very close to the expected 40% due to the large sample size. Deviations to 70% (or 210,000 snack purchasers) are extremely unlikely.
Small Family Park: With 30,000 visitors, there is more potential for deviation. While the expected number of snack purchasers is 12,000, a deviation to 70% (or 21,000 snack purchasers) is statistically more possible due to the smaller sample size.

Probability Analysis:

The likelihood of having over 30% of customers using warranty services can be analyzed using the binomial distribution properties and the law of large numbers.
Large Chain Store:
With 3000 warranty customers per quarter, the law of large numbers suggests that the proportion of customers using warranty services will be close to the expected 10%.
The standard deviation of the proportion will be smaller due to the larger number of customers, leading to less variability around the mean.
Small Family Operated Store:
With only 300 warranty customers per quarter, there is greater variability in the proportion of customers using warranty services.
The smaller sample size means that deviations from the expected 10% can be more pronounced, making it more likely to see extreme values like over 30%.

Conclusion:

Among them, car rental companies of different scales usually have 10% of customers renting cars each month causing varying degrees of damage to the cars. Which car rental company do you think is more likely to cause car damage when more than 30% of customers rent cars in a certain quarter?
A. Large national chain car rental companies
B. Small local family owned car rental shops
C. The rental situation of the two car rental companies is similar (with a difference of less than 5%)",B,"In this scenario, both the large national chain car rental company and the small local family-operated car rental agency experience 10% of their customers causing damage to the cars each month. When more than 30% of customers rent cars in a certain quarter, the likelihood of car damage would depend on the absolute numbers rather than percentages alone.
Given that the large national chain rents out 1000 cars per week compared to the small local rental shop renting out 100 cars per week, if more than 30% of customers rent cars, the large national chain would have a higher absolute number of cars rented out. This means that even though the percentage of damaging customers is the same for both, the large national chain would have more cars at risk of damage due to the higher volume of rentals.
Therefore, the large national chain car rental company is more likely to experience a higher number of customers causing damage to cars when more than 30% of customers rent cars in a certain quarter.",0,0,"To determine which car rental company is more likely to have more car damages when more than 30% of customers rent cars in a certain quarter, let's break down the numbers.
Given Data:

Large national chain car rental company:
Weekly rentals: 1000 cars
Monthly rentals: 1000℅4=4000 cars
Quarterly rentals: 4000℅3=12000 cars
Small local family-run car rental agency:
Weekly rentals: 100 cars
Monthly rentals: 100℅4=400 cars
Quarterly rentals: 400℅3=1200 cars

Damage Probability:

10% of customers renting cars each month cause damage to the cars.

Calculating the Number of Damages:

Large national chain car rental company:
Expected damages per month: 4000℅0.10=400 damages
Expected damages per quarter: 400℅3=1200 damages
Small local family-run car rental agency:
Expected damages per month: 400℅0.10=40 damages
Expected damages per quarter: 40℅3=120 damages

Scenario: More than 30% of customers rent cars in a quarter

Large national chain car rental company:
Customers renting in a quarter if over 30%: 12000℅0.30=3600 cars
Damages if over 30% of customers rent: 3600℅0.10=360 damages
Small local family-run car rental agency:
Customers renting in a quarter if over 30%: 1200℅0.30=360 cars
Damages if over 30% of customers rent: 360℅0.10=36 damages

Conclusion:

The large national chain car rental company has a significantly higher volume of rentals and thus, a higher absolute number of damages compared to the small local family-run car rental agency.
Since the damage rate is proportional to the number of rentals, the large national chain car rental company will always have more damages in absolute terms.

These two daycare centers record the number of days a child falls ill every week. Large daycare centers in the city center and small daycare centers in the suburbs generally do not have more than 30% of children getting sick every day. Which daycare center do you think records more sick days with a percentage higher than 60%?
A. A large daycare center in the city center
B. Small daycare centers in the suburbs
C. The percentages recorded by the two daycare centers are similar (i.e. the difference is within 5%)",B,"To determine which daycare center records more sick days with a percentage higher than 60%, we need to calculate the threshold for each daycare center and compare it to the 60% mark. Given that both centers generally do not have more than 30% of children getting sick every day, we first calculate the daily sick threshold for each center:
Large daycare center in the city center: 30% of 1000 children = 300 children
Small daycare center in the suburbs: 30% of 10 children = 3 children

Now, to assess which center records more sick days beyond 60%, we calculate the threshold for each to exceed 60%:
Large daycare center in the city center: 60% of 1000 children = 600 children
Small daycare center in the suburbs: 60% of 10 children = 6 children

Comparing these thresholds to the actual numbers, we find that both centers have higher numbers than their respective 60% thresholds if 60% of the children are getting sick each day. Therefore, the correct option is:
B. Small daycare centers in the suburbs.",1,1,"The large daycare center in the city center is likely to record more days with a percentage higher than 60%.
This can be understood through the concept of statistical variability and the law of large numbers. In a larger sample size (like the large daycare center with 1000 children), the daily percentage of sick children tends to be more stable and less variable due to the averaging effect over many individuals. This means extreme percentages (like more than 60% of children falling ill on a single day) are less likely.
In contrast, in a smaller sample size (like the small daycare center with 10 children), the percentage of sick children can vary more significantly from day to day. For example, if 7 out of 10 children fall ill on a given day, that's 70%, which is well above 60%. Such variability is more common in smaller groups.

C. The sales ratios of the two pet stores are similar (with a difference of less than 5%)",B,"To determine which pet store sells more than 60% of disease medications in a certain month, we can calculate the threshold for each store based on their monthly sales and the proportion of medications sold for illness.
Large chain pet stores sell 1000 bottles per month, and 40% of these are for disease treatment, which equals 400 bottles for illness treatment. To exceed 60% of disease medications, they would need to sell more than 600 bottles for disease treatment in a certain month.
Small family run pet stores sell about 50 bottles per month, with 40% used for illness treatment, which equals 20 bottles for illness treatment. To surpass 60% of disease medications, they would need to sell more than 30 bottles for disease treatment in a certain month.
Therefore, the large chain pet store is more likely to sell more than 60% of disease medications in a certain month, as they would have to sell 600 bottles or more for disease treatment, compared to the small family run pet store needing to sell 30 bottles or more for disease treatment.

When it comes to variability, smaller sample sizes (the small family-run pet store in this case) tend to exhibit greater fluctuations in percentages due to the lower number of total observations. Larger sample sizes (the large chain pet store) will have smaller fluctuations and be more stable around the average percentage.
Since the small family-run pet store has a smaller sample size (50 bottles per month), it is more susceptible to variations in the percentage of medications sold for disease treatment.

Therefore, the large chain fitness center is more likely to have more than 60% of new members lose more than 5 kilograms in a certain month.
Thus, the answer is:
A. Large chain fitness centers.",0,0,"To determine which fitness center is more likely to have more than 60% of new students lose more than 5 kilograms in a certain month, we can analyze the situation using probability and statistics, focusing on the law of large numbers and variance in smaller sample sizes.
Large Chain Fitness Center:
Admits 500 new members per week.
Typically, 20% of new members lose more than 5 kilograms each month.
In any given month, the expected number of members losing more than 5 kilograms is 0.20 * 500 = 100 members.
The proportion expected to lose more than 5 kilograms is 20%.
Small Private Gym:
Admits 10 new members per week.
Typically, 20% of new members lose more than 5 kilograms each month.
In any given month, the expected number of members losing more than 5 kilograms is 0.20 * 10 = 2 members.
The proportion expected to lose more than 5 kilograms is 20%.

To have more than 60% of members lose more than 5 kilograms, we need to look at the variability due to sample size:
Large Chain Fitness Center:
With 500 members, the probability distribution will be narrower due to the larger sample size.
It is highly unlikely for the proportion to deviate significantly from 20% because of the large sample size and the central limit theorem.
Small Private Gym:
With 10 members, the probability distribution will be much wider because of the smaller sample size.
It is more likely to see significant deviations from the expected 20% due to higher variance.
Specifically, achieving more than 60% would mean at least 6 out of 10 members (60%) lose more than 5 kilograms, which is relatively more probable in a smaller sample due to higher variability.

Conclusion:

The small private gym is more likely to have a month where more than 60% of new members lose more than 5 kilograms due to the higher variance and greater potential for deviation from the expected 20% in a smaller sample size.

Large Chain Bookstore:
Monthly sales: 10,000 books
30% of sales are bestsellers: 3,000 bestsellers
To have bestsellers accounting for over 60% of total sales (6,000 books), this would be more than half of their total monthly sales. Given the sales volume and the fact that only 30% are bestsellers, it is unlikely for the large chain bookstore to have bestsellers surpassing 60% of total sales in a month.
Small Independent Bookstore:
Monthly sales: 1,000 books
30% of sales are bestsellers: 300 bestsellers
To have bestsellers accounting for over 60% of total sales (600 books), this would be more than half of their total monthly sales. Due to the smaller scale of the independent bookstore, it is more likely for them to have bestsellers exceeding 60% of total sales in a month compared to the large chain bookstore.

Given these calculations, it is more likely that the Small Independent Bookstore (Option B) would have best-selling books accounting for over 60% of total sales in a certain month compared to the Large Chain Bookstore (Option A). The sales situation of the two bookstores is not similar, with the Small Independent Bookstore having a higher likelihood of achieving this scenario.",1,1,"The likelihood of best-selling books accounting for over 60% of total sales in a certain month is influenced by the variability in sales figures.

Small independent bookstores sell 1,000 books per month.

Typically, 30% of the sales are bestsellers.
Let's analyze the situation:
Large Chain Bookstore:
Average monthly sales of bestsellers: 10,000℅0.30=3,000
For bestsellers to account for over 60% of total sales, they would need to sell more than 10,000℅0.60=6,000 books.

Average monthly sales of bestsellers: 1,000℅0.30=300
For bestsellers to account for over 60% of total sales, they would need to sell more than 1,000℅0.60=600 books.

The small independent bookstore, with its smaller sales volume, will have higher variability in the proportion of bestsellers each month due to random fluctuations. This variability increases the likelihood of the proportion of bestsellers being significantly different from the average 30%, including being over 60%.

Within a year, large farms and small family run farms typically have 10% of their agricultural products unqualified every quarter. Which farm do you think is more likely to produce more substandard agricultural products with a proportion higher than 50% in a certain quarter?
A. Small family run farms

C. The yield situation of the two farms is similar (with a difference of less than 5%)",A,"The likelihood of producing more substandard agricultural products with a proportion higher than 50% in a certain quarter is higher for the small family run farms. Here's the reasoning behind it:
Large Farms:
Produce 1000 tons per quarter.
10% of the yield is unqualified, which amounts to 100 tons.
For the proportion of unqualified products to exceed 50%, they would need to have more than 500 tons of unqualified products in that quarter, which is unlikely given their large scale of production.
Small Family Run Farms:
Produce 10 tons per quarter.
10% of the yield is unqualified, which amounts to 1 ton.
For the proportion of unqualified products to exceed 50%, they would only need to have more than 5 tons of unqualified products in that quarter, a much more achievable threshold due to their smaller scale of production.

Therefore, the small family run farms are more likely to produce more substandard agricultural products with a proportion higher than 50% in a certain quarter compared to large farms.",1,1,"To determine which farm is more likely to produce more substandard agricultural products with a proportion higher than 50% in a certain quarter, let's analyze the given information.
Yield and Unqualified Products:
Large farms produce 1000 tons of agricultural products per quarter.
Small family run farms produce 10 tons of agricultural products per quarter.
Both have a 10% rate of unqualified products each quarter.
Calculation of Unqualified Products:
For large farms: 10% of 1000 tons = 100 tons of unqualified products per quarter.
For small family run farms: 10% of 10 tons = 1 ton of unqualified products per quarter.
Proportion of Unqualified Products Higher than 50%:
For large farms to have more than 50% of their products unqualified, they would need more than 500 tons of their 1000 tons to be unqualified.
For small family run farms to have more than 50% of their products unqualified, they would need more than 5 tons of their 10 tons to be unqualified.
Probability and Variability Consideration:
The large farm has a higher absolute production (1000 tons), which makes a deviation from the 10% unqualified rate to over 50% highly improbable due to the large number of products.
The small farm, with only 10 tons, is more susceptible to variability. A small fluctuation could easily result in more than 50% of the products being unqualified.

Given the higher variability and the lower production volume, small family run farms are more likely to experience a situation where more than 50% of their agricultural products are unqualified in a certain quarter.

Small Family Run Homestay:
Expected quarterly complaints: 50℅0.09=4.5.

Comparing the expected number of complaints, it's evident that the Small Family Run Homestay is more likely to receive complaints exceeding 20% in a certain quarter. This is because even a small increase in the actual number of complaints for the homestay can easily push the rate above 20%, given its considerably lower guest volume.
Therefore, the answer is:
C. Small family operated homestays",1,1,"Given the situation:
Large chain hotel receives 5000 guests per month.
Small family-run homestay receives 50 guests per month.
Both have a complaint rate of 9% per quarter.

We need to determine the likelihood of either hotel exceeding a 20% complaint rate in a certain quarter.
Calculation and Analysis:

Large Chain Hotel:
Quarterly guests = 5000 guests/month * 3 months = 15000 guests.
Expected complaints = 9% of 15000 = 0.09 * 15000 = 1350 complaints.
Small Family-Run Homestay:
Quarterly guests = 50 guests/month * 3 months = 150 guests.
Expected complaints = 9% of 150 = 0.09 * 150 = 13.5 complaints (approximately 14 complaints).

Statistical Variability:

Larger sample sizes (like the large chain hotel) tend to have more stable and predictable rates of complaints because the law of large numbers smooths out the fluctuations. Smaller sample sizes (like the family-run homestay) are more subject to variability.
Calculation for Exceeding 20% Complaint Rate:

Large Chain Hotel:
To exceed a 20% complaint rate:
Complaints needed = 20% of 15000 = 0.20 * 15000 = 3000 complaints.
The variance in complaints is less likely to lead to such a drastic increase due to the large number of guests.

Small Family-Run Homestay:

Complaints needed = 20% of 150 = 0.20 * 150 = 30 complaints.
With smaller numbers, the variability is higher, making it more likely to exceed the expected 9% complaint rate, potentially reaching or surpassing 20%.

This amounts to 100 drinks with potential taste complaints per week

For the small independent coffee shop:
Sales of best-selling coffee drinks per week: 50
10% of the drinks may have taste complaints
This results in 5 drinks with potential taste complaints per week

In a quarter (considered as about 13 weeks):
Large chain coffee shop could potentially receive around 1300 complaints (100 complaints per week * 13 weeks)
Small independent coffee shop might receive about 65 complaints (5 complaints per week * 13 weeks)

Comparing these potential complaints to the total number of drinks sold in a quarter:
Large chain coffee shop sells 13,000 drinks in a quarter (1000 drinks per week * 13 weeks)
Small independent coffee shop sells 650 drinks in a quarter (50 drinks per week * 13 weeks)

Calculating the percentage of potential complaints:
Large chain coffee shop: 1300 complaints / 13,000 drinks = 10%

Both repair shops have an expected 40% of customers choosing car wash services. However, the variability of the percentage will differ due to the different sample sizes.
Variability and Likelihood

Large Chain Repair Shop: With 1500 customers per quarter, the percentage of customers choosing car wash services is less likely to deviate significantly from the expected 40% due to the large sample size.
Small Independent Repair Shop: With only 30 customers per quarter, the percentage of customers choosing car wash services can vary more widely due to the smaller sample size. This variability means there's a higher chance that the actual percentage could deviate from the expected 40%, either higher or lower.

Conclusion

Given that the small independent repair shop has a smaller sample size, it is more susceptible to variability.

30% of customers give reviews of the food each week.
Small Family-Run Restaurant:
Sells 100 servings/week.
30% of customers give reviews of the food each week.

Calculations:

Number of Customers Providing Reviews per Week:
Large Chain Restaurant: 10,000 * 0.30 = 3,000 customers/week
Small Family-Run Restaurant: 100 * 0.30 = 30 customers/week

Given:
Large chain restaurant: 10,000 servings per week, 30% of customers typically give reviews.
Small family-run restaurant: 100 servings per week, 30% of customers typically give reviews.

Calculations per week:
Large chain restaurant: 10,000 servings * 30% = 3,000 reviews.
Small family-run restaurant: 100 servings * 30% = 30 reviews.

To consider a quarter (13 weeks):
Large chain restaurant: 13 weeks * 3,000 reviews = 39,000 reviews.
Small family-run restaurant: 13 weeks * 30 reviews = 390 reviews.

Now, we need to determine the likelihood of each restaurant exceeding 45% of customers giving reviews in a certain quarter.
Given the larger sample size (39,000 reviews vs. 390 reviews), the large chain restaurant's review rate is likely to be more stable and close to the expected 30%. The small family-run restaurant, with a much smaller sample size, is subject to greater variability due to random chance.

Weekly customers buying popcorn: 20% of 10,000 = 2,000 customers
Customers buying popcorn per month: 2,000 customers x 4 weeks = 8,000 customers

Here's a breakdown:
Large Multi Hall Chain Cinema:
Sells 10,000 tickets per month.
In a quarter (3 months), it sells 30,000 tickets.
On average, 20% of customers buy popcorn each week, so about 6,000 customers buy popcorn per quarter.
With such a large sample size (30,000), the proportion of popcorn buyers will be close to the true average (20%) due to the law of large numbers. The variability will be low, making it less likely to deviate significantly from 20%.
Small Independent Cinema:
Sells 100 tickets per month.
In a quarter (3 months), it sells 300 tickets.
On average, 20% of customers buy popcorn each week, so about 60 customers buy popcorn per quarter.
With a small sample size (300), the proportion of popcorn buyers can vary more significantly from the average (20%). This higher variability increases the chance of observing a proportion significantly different from the average, including proportions over 45%.

Analysis:
The large cinema, with its larger sample size, will have a proportion of popcorn buyers very close to 20%, making it highly unlikely to observe over 45%.
The small cinema, with its smaller sample size, will have more variability in the proportion of popcorn buyers, increasing the chance of observing over 45%.

Given this reasoning, the small independent cinema is more likely to have over 45% of customers buying popcorn in a certain quarter due to higher variability in small sample sizes.
Answer: C. Small independent cinema",1,1,"Based on the provided ticket sales data and the assumption that 20% of customers from cinemas of different sizes buy popcorn, we can analyze the likelihood of each cinema having over 45% of customers buying popcorn in a quarter:
Large multi hall chain cinema: Sells 10,000 tickets per month. Assuming 20% buy popcorn weekly translates to approximately 2,000 customers buying popcorn per month. In a quarter (3 months), this would be 6,000 popcorn buyers. If this cinema has 45% of customers buying popcorn, it would need 4,500 customers buying popcorn in the quarter.
Small independent cinema: Sells 100 tickets per month. Assuming 20% buy popcorn weekly means approximately 20 customers buying popcorn per month. In a quarter, this would be 60 popcorn buyers. For this cinema to reach 45% of customers buying popcorn, it would need 45 customers buying popcorn in the quarter.

Comparing these scenarios:
For the large multi hall chain cinema, reaching 4,500 popcorn buyers in a quarter out of 10,000 ticket buyers is feasible, as it requires maintaining a steady rate of popcorn purchases around the 45% mark.
For the small independent cinema, reaching 45 popcorn buyers in a quarter out of 100 ticket buyers is challenging, as it requires a consistently high rate of popcorn purchases, significantly higher than the average 20%.

Given that the souvenir purchase rate is the same for both venues at 50%, we can evaluate the absolute number of souvenir buyers per week:
Large Art Museum:
Souvenir buyers per week: 10,000 * 50% = 5,000
Small Gallery:
Souvenir buyers per week: 100 * 50% = 50

To reach over 70% of customers purchasing souvenirs in a certain quarter, we need to calculate the total number of souvenir buyers in a quarter and then see if that percentage crosses 70%.
For the large art museum with 5,000 souvenir buyers per week:
Total souvenir buyers in a quarter: 5,000 * 12 weeks = 60,000

For the small gallery with 50 souvenir buyers per week:

50% of customers typically purchase souvenirs each week

The key points to consider are the sample size and variability:
Sample Size: Larger sample sizes tend to have more stable averages and less variability. Smaller sample sizes can exhibit greater variability and fluctuation.
Probability Calculation:
For the large art museum:
Average visitors per quarter (13 weeks) = 10,000 visitors/week * 13 weeks = 130,000 visitors
Expected number of souvenir purchasers = 130,000 * 50% = 65,000 purchasers
To achieve over 70% purchasing souvenirs, we need more than 91,000 purchasers (130,000 * 70%).
For the small gallery:
Average visitors per quarter (13 weeks) = 100 visitors/week * 13 weeks = 1,300 visitors
Expected number of souvenir purchasers = 1,300 * 50% = 650 purchasers
To achieve over 70% purchasing souvenirs, we need more than 910 purchasers (1,300 * 70%).

Because of the smaller sample size, the small gallery is more likely to see significant variations in percentage terms due to randomness and fewer data points. The large art museum, with its significantly larger number of visitors, will have a more stable percentage close to the expected 50%, making it less likely to deviate significantly from this mean.

Quarterly Visitors: 1,000 * 3 = 3,000
Average Snack Purchasers (40%): 0.40 * 3,000 = 1,200

Statistical Variation:

The law of large numbers suggests that larger samples will more closely approximate the true probability (40% in this case). Therefore, the large theme parks with 300,000 visitors are less likely to see extreme variations from the 40% mark.
The small family park with only 3,000 visitors can experience more significant percentage swings due to the smaller sample size. This makes it more likely to have extreme values like over 70% of customers purchasing snacks in any given quarter.

Probability Distribution:

For the large theme park, with 300,000 visitors, the distribution of the percentage of snack purchasers will be tightly clustered around the 40% mark.
For the small family park, with 3,000 visitors, the distribution will be wider, making it more susceptible to higher variance and potentially reaching over 70%.

Both stores have 10% of customers using warranty services per month.
Quarterly Sales and Warranty Use:
Over a quarter (3 months), the large chain store sells $3,000,000, and the small family store sells $30,000.
10% of customers use warranty services each month. Over 3 months, this translates to 30% (assuming no customer uses the service more than once).
Probability Analysis:
For the large chain store, with a large number of customers (implied by the high sales volume), the proportion of customers using warranty services is likely to stay close to the expected 10% due to the law of large numbers. Thus, it's less likely to deviate significantly from the expected value (i.e., over 30% in any given quarter).
For the small family store, with fewer customers, there's a higher chance of variability. If just a few more customers than average use warranty services, the percentage could easily exceed 30% in a given quarter due to the small sample size.

In both scenarios, 10% of customers cause varying degrees of damage to the cars each month.
If more than 30% of customers rent cars in a certain quarter, the small local family-owned car rental shop is more susceptible to a higher proportion of damaging customers due to its smaller scale, resulting in a higher likelihood of car damage.

Therefore, the small local family-operated car rental shop is more likely to experience car damage when more than 30% of customers rent cars in a certain quarter.",1,1,"To determine which car rental company is more likely to cause car damage when more than 30% of customers rent cars in a certain quarter, let's break down the scenario with the given data:
Large national chain car rental company:
Weekly rentals: 1000 cars
Monthly rentals: 1000 cars * 4 weeks = 4000 cars
Quarterly rentals: 4000 cars * 3 months = 12000 cars
Small local family-owned car rental shop:
Weekly rentals: 10 cars
Monthly rentals: 10 cars * 4 weeks = 40 cars
Quarterly rentals: 40 cars * 3 months = 120 cars

Both companies have 10% of customers causing damage each month.
First, calculate the percentage of damaged cars per quarter:
For the large national chain:
10% of 12000 cars per quarter = 1200 cars damaged
For the small local family-owned shop:
10% of 120 cars per quarter = 12 cars damaged

Next, let's consider the scenario where more than 30% of customers rent cars in a quarter:
Large national chain: 30% of 12000 cars = 3600 cars
Small local family-owned shop: 30% of 120 cars = 36 cars

If more than 30% of customers rent cars in a quarter, this would likely increase the number of cars rented and, consequently, the potential for damage.
However, the proportion of cars that get damaged (10%) remains the same for both companies. Therefore, the large national chain will still see more cars damaged in absolute numbers due to its larger scale of operations.
Thus, the most appropriate answer is:
A. Large national chain car rental companies
They are more likely to cause car damage simply because they rent out significantly more cars than the small local family-owned shops, leading to a higher absolute number of damages.",0,0,"When more than 30% of customers rent cars in a certain quarter, it's more likely that the large national chain car rental companies will experience more car damage. Due to their larger scale, even with a smaller percentage of customers causing damage, the absolute number of damaged cars could be higher compared to the small local family-owned car rental shops. Therefore, the answer is A. Large national chain car rental companies.",0,0
