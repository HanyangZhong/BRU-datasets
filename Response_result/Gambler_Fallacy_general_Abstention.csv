You are playing a lottery game where there is a special winning ticket in the prize pool. After each draw, the ticket that did not win will be returned to the prize pool. Several rounds of drawing have been conducted, but the special winning ticket has not yet been drawn. Considering the fact that the special winning ticket has not yet been drawn, please choose which of the following options best describes the probability of winning the next draw:
Option:
A. Higher than usual
B. Same probability as each previous extraction
C. Below normal
E. I am not sure which option is the best to select",B,"Cognitive Bias Definition:
A cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. Individuals create their own ""subjective reality"" from their perception of the input. An individual's construction of reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behavior in the world. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.
Lottery Game Analysis:
In the scenario described for the lottery game, where the non-winning ticket is returned to the prize pool after each draw, the probability of drawing the special winning ticket remains the same for each draw. This is because the same set of tickets, including the winning ticket, is available for each draw, making each drawing event independent of the previous ones.
Thus, the correct choice would be:
B. Same probability as each previous extraction
This choice reflects an understanding that the probability does not change just because the ticket has not been drawn in previous rounds. This is a way to avoid the ""gambler's fallacy,"" a cognitive bias where one might incorrectly assume that previous events affect the likelihood of an independent random event.",1,1,0,"Definition of Cognitive Bias:
Cognitive bias refers to a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, whereby inferences about other people and situations may be drawn in an illogical fashion. These biases are often a result of the brain's attempt to simplify information processing. They can affect various aspects of decision-making, perception, and memory.
Choosing the Option:
Given the context of the lottery game, where each ticket is returned to the pool after each draw, the probability of drawing the special winning ticket remains unchanged for each draw. Therefore, the probability of winning in the next draw is the same as it was in each previous draw. The fact that the special ticket has not yet been drawn does not influence the odds of it being drawn next, as each draw is an independent event.
Thus, the best option is:
B. Same probability as each previous extraction",1,1,0,"The probability of winning the next draw in this lottery game remains unchanged from each previous extraction, so the correct option is:
B. Same probability as each previous extraction

Cognitive bias refers to systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, where individuals create their own subjective reality from their perception of the input. These biases often result from the brain's attempt to simplify information processing and can lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.
Avoiding Cognitive Biases

To avoid cognitive biases, it's important to:
Be aware of common cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring bias, and availability heuristic.
Seek out diverse perspectives and challenge your assumptions.
Use data and evidence-based reasoning to inform decisions.
Reflect on past decisions to identify and correct biases.
Slow down decision-making processes to allow for more deliberate and rational thinking.
