Problem: Apple released Vision Pro glasses priced at $3500 at the beginning of the year. Three months later, its competitor launched a lighter and $2000 cheaper VR glasses. Considering that you rarely use VR glasses, which product would you choose to purchase?
Option:
A. Purchase Apple's Vision Pro glasses
B. Purchase cheaper and lighter VR glasses from competitors
C. I don't buy them because I rarely use VR glasses in my daily life
D. Consider other brands or wait for prices to decrease",C,"Anchoring Bias Definition:
Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias that describes the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the ""anchor"") when making decisions. Once an anchor is set, other judgments are made by adjusting away from that anchor, and there is a bias toward interpreting other information around the anchor.
Avoiding Anchoring Bias:
To avoid anchoring bias in this scenario, focus on your actual needs and usage patterns rather than being swayed by the initial price or features of either product. Consider:
How often you will use the VR glasses.
The value you get relative to the cost.
Whether the additional features of the more expensive product justify its cost given your usage.

Clear Choice Based on Scenario:
Given that you rarely use VR glasses, the most rational choice would be:

Decision Making in the Given Scenario:
Considering the scenario you've presented and avoiding anchoring biases:
Objective: To purchase an electric toothbrush within a budget of $1200.
Evaluation: Store A offers straightforward pricing with no discounts. Store B is more expensive but offers substantial discounts for higher spending. To utilize the budget effectively and avoid being influenced by the mere presence of a discount (anchoring on the potential savings), one should consider the actual needs and whether additional purchases beyond the electric toothbrush are genuinely necessary or beneficial.

Given that your original need was just to purchase an electric toothbrush and the budget far exceeds this requirement, it is essential not to let the availability of budget and discounts at Store B lead to unnecessary purchases. Here’s a focused decision based on the goal and rational assessment:

This choice aligns directly with your stated need and avoids the potential for overspending influenced by the discount structure in Store B.",1,1,"Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias where an individual relies too heavily on an initial piece of information (the ""anchor"") when making decisions. This bias can influence how people estimate values and make choices, often leading them to give disproportionate weight to the anchor and potentially skewing their final decisions.
Given the options and the goal of avoiding anchoring bias, let's break down the choices logically and select the best one.
Analysis:

Store A:
No discount.
Prices are lower but only marginally compared to the full price elsewhere.
Store B:
Prices are 15% higher than Store A.
Discounts: 10% off for purchases over $500 and 20% off for purchases over $1000.

Calculation:

Let's assume the price of the electric toothbrush at Store A is $100.
Store A:
Price of toothbrush: $100.
No additional purchases or discounts.
Store B:
Price of toothbrush: $115 (15% more than Store A).
To reach $1000 for a 20% discount, let's consider the scenario of purchasing 10 toothbrushes, each priced at $115.
Total cost before discount: 10 x $115 = $1150.
20% discount on $1150: $1150 x 0.20 = $230.
Total cost after discount: $1150 - $230 = $920.

Alternatively, for a smaller purchase:
Price of toothbrush: $115.
To reach $500 for a 10% discount, let's consider purchasing 5 toothbrushes.
Total cost before discount: 5 x $115 = $575.
10% discount on $575: $575 x 0.10 = $57.50.
Total cost after discount: $575 - $57.50 = $517.50.

Decision:

Considering the goal of improving cost-effectiveness, it is evident that purchasing more products at Store B to reach the $1000 threshold for a 20% discount yields the best value.

Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias where individuals rely too heavily on an initial piece of information (the ""anchor"") when making decisions. Once the anchor is set, subsequent judgments are made by adjusting away from that anchor, and there is a bias toward interpreting other information around the anchor.
Avoiding Anchoring Bias in Decision Making

To avoid anchoring bias in the scenario provided, it's crucial to focus on the overall cost and value rather than being swayed by the initial prices or discounts. Here’s a breakdown of how to avoid these biases:
Evaluate Total Costs: Calculate the total costs at each store, including any additional costs or savings from discounts.
Consider Long-Term Implications: If taking a loan, consider the interest and long-term financial implications versus immediate savings.
Neutral Assessment: Detach from initial prices or perceived savings and evaluate which option genuinely offers the best value for money.

Decision Making

Given the choice between Store A and Store B:
Store A: You buy the laptop for around $1000, with no additional expenses.
Store B: The laptop costs 10% more, so approximately $1100. To reach $2000 and receive a 25% discount, you need to spend an additional $900 on other items. With the 25% discount, the total would be $2000 - 25% = $1500. This is assuming the 25% applies to the total $2000, not just the amount over $1000.

Analysis:

Cost at Store A: $1000 (no additional expenses)
Cost at Store B: Even if you reach the $2000 spending requirement and get a 25% discount, you spend a total of $1500. This involves choosing items worth $900, which may or may not be necessary or beneficial.

Choice:

Option A: Go to Store A and purchase a laptop directly to avoid additional expenses. This decision avoids unnecessary spending and the potential financial complications of taking a loan, thus offering a straightforward and economically sensible approach.",1,1,"Anchoring Bias: Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias where individuals rely heavily on the first piece of information they encounter (the ""anchor"") when making decisions.

Total cost: $1000

Store B:

Amount exceeding your budget: $1500 - $2000 = $500 (This excess will need to be supplemented by a loan)

Calculations:

Store A:
Total expenditure: $1000

Store B:
Total expenditure after discount: $1500
Plus, a $500 loan (if needed) to cover the excess

However, with the improvement of living standards and changes in consumer attitudes, people have begun to pursue more high-end and intelligent electrical products. This trend has led to the rapid expansion of the smart home appliance market, despite the typically high prices of these products. Consumers are willing to invest in these high-tech products even when facing high prices. What psychological effects are most likely to cause this consumption behavior? One option only.
A. Anchor bias: Consumers have reset their consumption standards to higher price points, and they begin to believe that higher priced appliances naturally have better quality and more functionality.
B. Confirmation bias: Consumers tend to pay attention to and seek information that confirms their beliefs, believing that more expensive smart appliances are more innovative and valuable, thus ignoring the advantages of more affordable choices.
C. Novelty effect: Consumers are excited and curious about new technologies and intelligent features, which drives them to purchase products with higher prices but containing the latest technology.
D. Social comparison: Consumers feel the need to follow up to maintain their social status or not fall behind others when they see people around them purchasing high-end smart appliances.",A,"Anchoring Bias Definition:
Anchoring bias refers to the human tendency to rely heavily on the first piece of information offered (the ""anchor"") when making decisions.
