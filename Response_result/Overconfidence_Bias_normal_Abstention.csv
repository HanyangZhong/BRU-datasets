His confidence, if based on a solid foundation of past success and a thorough understanding of the product, can indeed contribute to a successful outcome, particularly in sales where conveying confidence can be crucial.
However, the detail that he ""did not spend extra time on targeted preparation"" specifically for this critical and large presentation introduces a risk factor.
