Cognitive biases can affect decisions and judgments, often leading people to favor certain conclusions over others based on pre-existing beliefs or incomplete information.
Answer to the question:
Given the context that 35% of employees are engineers and 65% are salespeople, and knowing that an employee won a technology innovation competition, the likelihood of the winner being from the Engineering Department might seem intuitively higher due to the relevance of engineering skills to technology innovation.
However, to avoid cognitive bias and especially the base rate fallacy, it is essential to consider the base rates provided:
35% of employees are engineers.
65% of employees are salespeople.

Without additional specific information about the competition or the relative participation rates and skills of engineers versus salespeople in the competition, it is statistically more probable that the winner is from the larger group (salespeople).

In an airline, the staff distribution is as follows: pilots account for 10%, and airport ground staff account for 90%.

Given the distribution of airline staff where 90% are airport ground staff and only 10% are pilots, and considering the fact that 75% of the vision problem reports are due to prolonged screen exposure, it's statistically more likely that the reports would mostly involve the group that makes up the larger percentage of the workforce. Thus, the airport ground staff, who represent 90% of the workforce, would statistically be more likely to be the ones reporting vision problems due to screen exposure, despite what may be a common assumption that pilots would experience more issues due to their use of screens in cockpits.

In the scenario you presented, it might seem logical to assume that a student from the science major would win a math competition due to the association of science with quantitative skills. However, given that 70% of the students study humanities and only 30% study science, there are more than twice as many humanities students as science students. Therefore, even if a smaller proportion of humanities students are strong in math, the larger number of humanities students overall increases the probability that the winner could be from the humanities.

Cognitive bias refers to a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, whereby inferences about other people and situations may be drawn in an illogical fashion.

Answer to the problem:
Given the competition and the fact that a student won, cognitive biases such as the base rate fallacy might influence our decision.

To solve the given problem, let's use the provided information and basic probability.
Business School A has 40,000 students.
University B has 10,000 students.
10% of fines are for science and technology books.

Given that a fine involves science and technology books, we want to determine which university the fine is more likely to have come from.
We can assume:
Let P(A) be the probability that a student from University A borrowed a science and technology book and received a fine.
Let P(B) be the probability that a student from University B borrowed a science and technology book and received a fine.

First, let's assume the probability of a fine involving science and technology books is the same for both universities. Since the number of students is different, the expected number of students fined for science and technology books should be proportional to the student population.
The number of fines involving science and technology books is proportional to the number of students at each university. So:
P(A)=

 =0.8
P(B)=

Option A: Business School A.

Given that 10% of fines are from science and technology book borrowings, and knowing the student populations of the two universities (40000 at A and 10000 at B), you can calculate the expected frequencies based on these percentages.

The occupational distribution in a city is: software engineers account for 30%, sales personnel account for 50%, and doctors account for 20%. In a survey, it was found that 40% of all reported health issues were related to problems caused by prolonged sitting, such as back pain and neck tension. If you know that a randomly selected health issue is caused by prolonged sitting, which profession do you think is most likely to be involved in this health issue?
Option:
A. Software Engineer
B. Sales personnel
C. Doctor
E. I am not sure which option is the best to select",B,"Cognitive Bias Definition: Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, whereby inferences about other people and situations may be drawn in an illogical fashion. Individuals create their own ""subjective social reality"" from their perception of the input. An individual's construction of social reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behavior in the social world. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.
Answer to Your Scenario: To analyze which profession is most likely involved with the health issue related to prolonged sitting, we need to consider both the proportion of each profession in the city and the nature of each job.
Software engineers (30% of the population): Typically work in settings that involve prolonged periods of sitting, such as at computers or desks.
Sales personnel (50% of the population): May also experience prolonged sitting, especially those in roles that involve office work or driving. However, many sales roles include varying amounts of movement.
Doctors (20% of the population): Although doctors can spend time sitting (e.g., during consultations), their jobs often require more mobility compared to the other two professions.

Given the nature of the work, software engineers and sales personnel are more likely to experience issues related to prolonged sitting compared to doctors. However, because sales personnel make up a larger portion of the population (50%), it increases the likelihood that a randomly selected health issue related to prolonged sitting involves someone from this group.
Thus, option B. Sales personnel is a reasonable choice, though without specific data linking the professions directly to the health issues, a definitive conclusion can't be made. This aligns with avoiding cognitive biases by not over-relying on stereotypical job functions (software engineers sitting) and considering the distribution and nature of all jobs involved.",1,1,0,"Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, leading individuals to create their own subjective reality from their perception of the input. These biases often result in errors in reasoning, evaluating, and remembering, affecting decisions and judgments.
In the given scenario, since prolonged sitting is mentioned as a cause of health issues, it would make sense to consider which profession is most likely to involve prolonged sitting.
Software Engineers often sit for long periods working on computers.
Sales Personnel might be active and mobile, although some sales roles might involve desk work.
Doctors can have varied roles, with some sitting for consultations and others being more active.

There are three widely used modes of public transportation in a big city: subway, bus, and taxi. In a statistic, buses carry 40% of passengers, subways carry 50% of passengers, and taxis carry 10% of passengers. Recent data shows that in all public transportation accidents, passenger injuries are sometimes involved. If you know that a randomly selected public transportation accident involves passenger injuries, which type of transportation do you think the accident is most likely to occur on?

Regarding your question about public transportation accidents involving passenger injuries, to answer without a cognitive bias such as availability heuristics or anchoring, we should rely on statistical likelihood rather than assumptions or recent memorable incidents.
Given the statistics provided:
Buses carry 40% of passengers.
Subways carry 50% of passengers.
Taxis carry 10% of passengers.

Assuming that the likelihood of an accident is uniformly distributed across the types of transportation (without any specific data indicating otherwise), an accident involving passenger injuries is most likely to occur on the type of transportation that carries the most passengers. Therefore, based on the numbers:
The subway, which carries the highest percentage of passengers (50%), would statistically be the most likely scene of an accident involving passenger injuries if all other factors are equal.

Examples include confirmation bias, where one seeks out information confirming preexisting beliefs, and availability bias, where judgments are influenced by readily available information. Avoiding biases involves employing critical thinking, seeking diverse perspectives, and considering objective evidence rather than relying solely on intuition or initial impressions.
Regarding the transportation accident scenario:
Given the distribution of passengers:
Buses carry 40% of passengers,
Subways carry 50% of passengers,
Taxis carry 10% of passengers.

If passenger injuries occur in a randomly selected public transportation accident, we need to determine which type of transportation is most likely involved.
Calculating likelihood based on passenger distribution:
Probability of a bus accident causing injuries: 40% (passenger share) ¡Á unknown injury probability.
Probability of a subway accident causing injuries: 50% (passenger share) ¡Á unknown injury probability.
Probability of a taxi accident causing injuries: 10% (passenger share) ¡Á unknown injury probability.

Without knowing the injury probability for each mode, we can only infer that:
Since subways carry the highest percentage of passengers (50%), a randomly selected injury is more likely to occur in a subway accident.

Therefore, the most reasonable choice, based on passenger distribution alone, would be:

Without additional information about the correlation between the type of housing and the incidence of thefts, any choice among the options A, B, or C would involve speculation. Since no type of housing is specified as being more or less secure in the provided statistics, making a choice would likely involve a bias known as the base rate neglect or the representativeness heuristic.

Cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. It often occurs when people process and interpret information in a way that deviates from logical reasoning, typically due to personal preferences, experiences, or pre-existing beliefs.
Decision-Making with Cognitive Biases

Given the data:
High-rise residential apartments: 50%
Old-fashioned apartment buildings: 30%
Unsecured suburban detached houses: 20%

Surveys show theft is frequent in the city. We need to determine the most likely type of housing for a randomly selected household theft.
To make an informed decision, avoid the following cognitive biases:
Availability Bias: Judging events based on how easily examples come to mind, possibly leading to overestimating urban theft due to media reports.
Representativeness Bias: Assuming that theft patterns in one area represent all areas without considering actual statistical data.
Base Rate Fallacy: Ignoring the base rate (overall proportions of housing types) and focusing only on theft frequency in specific areas.

Analysis

Base Rate: Given the overall distribution of housing types:
50% high-rise residential apartments
30% old-fashioned apartment buildings
20% unsecured suburban detached houses
Theft Frequency in the City: Since the survey shows thefts are frequent in the city, focus on urban housing types: high-rise residential apartments and old-fashioned apartment buildings.
Probability Calculation: Calculate the probability of theft occurring in each type of housing considering the base rates.

Given the lack of specific theft rate data for each housing type, we assume theft is equally likely within the urban area.
High-rise residential apartments: 50% of all housing
Old-fashioned apartment buildings: 30% of all housing

Given a theft has occurred, the probability that it happened in a high-rise apartment or old-fashioned building is proportional to their base rates.
Conclusion

Given the base rate and the fact that urban theft is frequent, the most likely type of housing for a randomly selected household theft is:

A country is divided into three regions: Region A, Region B, and Region C. Region A has a dense urban structure and busy transportation, accounting for 8% of the total land area of the country. Region B is relatively suburban, with more natural landscapes and fewer roads, accounting for 21%. Region C is a major industrial zone, accounting for 70% of the country's land area. If you know that a randomly selected traffic accident has occurred, which region do you think the accident is most likely to occur in?
Option:
A. Region A
B. Region B
C. Region C
E. I am not sure which option is the best to select",C,"A cognitive bias refers to a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, whereby inferences about other people and situations may be drawn in an illogical fashion. Cognitive biases can arise from various sources such as the human brain's limited capacity to process information, emotional and moral motivations, or the influence of social environment.
Now, regarding your question about the traffic accident, a decision without additional specific data on traffic volumes, road lengths, or accident rates per region might indeed invoke cognitive biases such as representativeness bias or base rate neglect. However, if we were to simplify the assumption based purely on the area proportion and assuming that the likelihood of an accident is uniformly distributed across all land area, it would suggest that Region C, being the largest area (70% of the land), might be the most probable place for a traffic accident to occur. This conclusion is also subject to assumptions and simplifications, and real-world data might suggest otherwise.
Thus, if I must choose an option based on the information provided, I would choose:
C. Region C
